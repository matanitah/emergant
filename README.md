# 🐜 **Emergant: An Ant Colony Simulator** 🐜  
_A world of tiny creatures, driven by simple rules, yet creating complex societies._

## 🎯 **About**  
**Emergant** is an ant colony simulator built with **PyGame**, where **machine learning** and **evolutionary algorithms** drive the emergence of lifelike ant behaviors. Watch as virtual ants forage for food, defend their nests, and adapt their strategies over time—all without explicit scripting of their behaviors!

## 🧠 **How It Works**  
- **🐜 Ant AI** – Each ant follows basic instincts, but their collective interactions create intelligent colony-wide behavior.
- **🌱 Evolutionary Algorithms** – Ant colonies evolve over multiple generations, improving efficiency and survival.
- **🗺️ Dynamic Environments** – The world changes as ants alter their surroundings, leaving pheromone trails and responding to environmental shifts.
- **🎮 PyGame Visualization** – The simulation runs in real-time with an interactive graphical interface.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**  
### ▶️ Run the Simulation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/matanitah/emergant.git
   cd emergant
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the simulation:  
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## ⚙️ **Features**  
✅ Fully interactive **visualization with PyGame**

✅ Ants seek out food and bring them back to their colonies

✅ Pheromone tracking

✅ Ant combat


## 🏗️ **Planned Features**  
🚧 Multi-colony relatedness measure to allow for multi-colony cooperation or warfare  
🚧 More complex environments (weather, terrain, obstacles)  
🚧 Use of selection or reinforcement learning to allow ants to learn to use pheromones autonomously
