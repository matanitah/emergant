# 🐜 **Emergant: An Ant Colony Simulator** 🐜  
_A world of tiny creatures, driven by simple rules, yet creating complex societies._

## 🎯 **About**  
**Emergant** is an ant colony simulator built with **PyGame**, where **reinforcement learning** drives the emergence of lifelike ant behaviors. Watch as virtual ants forage for food, defend their nests, and adapt their strategies over time—all without explicit scripting of their behaviors!

## **How It Works**  
- **🌱 Reinforcement Learning** – Ants from the same colony are all collected by one hivemind, and learn to bring food back to their colony using a system of rewards and penalties.
- **🧠 Neuroevolutionary Algorithm** - The neural network structure of each hivemind evolves from generation to generation through natural selection.
- **🎮 PyGame Visualization** – The simulation runs in real-time with an interactive graphical interface. There is also a neural network visualization utility to get deeper insights into the weights of the networks and to increase explainability.
